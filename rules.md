2-8 Players • Ages 8 & Up

## CONTENTS

136 playing cards
5 six-sided dice
25 chop tokens
Rules sheet


## SETUP

Separate the Tree Deck from the Jack Deck
and place them face down in the center of the
table. Deal each player three cards from the
Jack Deck face down. Roll for
who starts.

## PLAYING THE GAME
**1.** Draw a Tree card (if you don’t have one)
    and place it face up in front of you.
**2.** Draw a card from the Jack Deck.
**3.** Play a card from your hand.
**4.** Roll your chopping roll (if you can).
**5.** Mark your tree with a chop token for
    each successful chop.
**6.** Play continues to the left.


## SCORING

When you have reached or exceeded the
required number of chops for your tree,
marked in the axe blade at the
bottom of the card, place it face up
in your cut pile.
You have now earned the points for that tree
marked in the tree symbol at the
bottom of the card. Points should
be visible to all players.

## WINNING THE GAME

The first player to have
21 points worth of trees in
their cut pile wins the game.


## How to play
```
### Playing a card

You can play a card either in front
of yourself or on another player. If you cannot play
any cards in your hand, you must discard one card
to the discard pile. Each player may only have one
of any unique card in play at any time. (Example:
You may not have more than one Apprentice or Axe
in play. If you play a second axe, the first axe is
discarded.)

### Equipment cards

Equipment cards are played
and remain in play until someone takes them or a
card discards them.

#### Axe cards

Allow you to roll 3 dice for
your chopping roll. Exceptions are...
- Titanium Axe: Allows you to roll 4 dice
for your chopping roll. Titanium Axes
do not break. They can only be stolen or
replaced.
- Dull Axe: Allows you to roll only 2 dice
for your chopping roll. May be played
on another player to replace their axe.

### Plus/Minus cards

These cards give you more
or fewer dice for your chopping roll. Add or subtract
dice equal to the number on these cards. All Plus/
Minus cards (except Blisters) remain in play only
until you are able to make a chopping roll and are
discarded after that chopping roll. (Blisters remains
in play until the player has Gloves.)

### Help cards: Once played these cards remain in
play until another card discards them. Help cards can
be taken from another player by playing the Lure
Help card.
Apprentice: Gives you one bonus die. You do not
need an axe to use an Apprentice. The Apprentice
die is rolled separately from your chopping roll
and does not contribute to a break. Plus/minus
cards do not apply to an Apprentice roll.
Long Saw & Partner: Set your axe in play aside.
Roll 5 dice for your chopping roll. If any four of
the dice come up as breaks and/or misses the Long
Saw & Partner card is passed to the player to your
right.

### Sasquatch cards

Any Sasquatch card played
discards all Help cards in play unless it is Debunked.
Sasquatch Sighting:
All players, except the
player who played the
card, roll one die. On
a roll of 1, 2 or 3 that
player loses their next
turn; rolls of 4, 5, or 6
do not lose a turn.
Sasquatch Mating Season: The player this
card is played on loses their next turn. You
may take their tree in play for your own
(chop tokens stay with the tree). If you take
that player’s tree you must discard your own
tree and any chop tokens on it.
That Darn Sasquatch: Discards all
Equipment cards in play.

### Other cards
Debunk: Stops any Sasquatch card. Any
player may play Debunk even if they are not
the target of the Sasquatch card. Both cards
are discarded. Immediately draw another card
to replace Debunk.
Switch Tags: Allows you to switch one of
your cut down trees with a cut down tree from
another player.
Tree Hugger: Makes whomever it is played
on lose one turn.
Paperwork: Stops Tree Hugger and Switch
Tags. Any player may play Paperwork even if
they are not the target of the Tree Hugger or
Switch Tags card. Both cards are discarded.
Immediately draw another card to replace
Paperwork.
Axe Break: Discards another player’s axe.
Cannot be played on a
Titanium Axe.
Paul Bunyan: Chops down
every tree in play. Each
player moves their tree into
their cut pile.
Forest Fire: Discards all
trees and any chop tokens
in play.


### Tree Deck cards

Each tree requires a number of chops to be
reached before it can be moved to
your cut pile. The required number
of chops is marked in the axe blade
at the bottom of the card.

Each tree is worth the number of
points marked in the tree symbol at
the bottom of the card.

### Chopping Roll

If you have an Axe or Long Saw & Partner
card in play you may roll the appropriate
number of dice for your chopping roll. Dice
may be added or reduced by Plus/Minus cards.


One or two: counts toward a break
Three: the axe misses completely
Four, five or six: the axe makes a chop

If 3 dice show breaks (ones or twos) in any
one chopping roll your axe breaks and is
discarded. Apprentice rolls are separate and
**do not** contribute to an axe break.

Place one chop token on your tree card for
each successful chop
(4, 5, or 6).

If you do not have
an Axe or Long Saw
& Partner card in
play you cannot roll
a chopping roll and
play moves to the next
player on your left.
